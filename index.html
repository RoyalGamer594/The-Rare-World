            <p>The Rare World helps animals that are going extinct. Our goal is help all these animals,
                and help them in recreating their habitats. We are also aiming to free animals from zoos, and 
                life peacfully in the wild, without any human distractions. Remember this quote,
                "We need nature, but nature does not need us."

                    <ul>
                        <li>Poulation: About 10</li>
                        <li>Location: Nothern Part of Gulf of California</li>
                        <li>Current Conservation Status: Critically Endenagered</li>
                    </ul>
                    The Vaquita is currently the rarest animal in the world, and quite possibly the most endangered,
                    with only about 10 individuals left in the wild. That estimate comes from a report published by the
                    IUCN in early 2019 that stated that only about 10 vaquitas remained alive in 2018, as per an
                    acoustic monitoring program conducted in the Gulf, though there is a 95% chance they number between
                    6 and 22.
                    Since the Vaquita was first discovered in 1958, its numbers have always been pretty low. Vaquitas
                    are the smallest species of porpoise and easily get caught in gillnets (nets that catch fish by
                    their gills) used by illegal fishing operations. Also Vaquitas have such a small population because
                    they are only found in one area of the world, the northern part of the Gulf of California.
                    Additionally, there are no Vaquita in captivity and there is currently no successful breeding
                    program to help bring their numbers back up.

                        <li>Poulation: 300-400</li>
                        <li>Location: Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Montana, USA</li>

                    </ul>
                    The population of the Black-footed Ferret sharply declined throughout the 20th century and was
                    declared extinct in 1979. A few years later, in 1981, the Black-footed Ferret was re-discovered by a
                    dog in Wyoming. That remaining population only survived until 1987 and the Black-footed Ferret was
                    extinct in the wild again. Since then, a captive breeding program was launched by the United States
                    Fish and Wildlife Service and thousands of Black-footed Ferrets were re-released in Arizona,
                    Wyoming, South Dakota, and Montana throughout the last few decades. While, the program has mostly
                    been a success, recent updates only put the wild Black-footed Ferret population between 300 to 400
                    individuals.

                    </ul>
                    Of all the animals on this list, none are as mysterious as the Saola, which has been aptly dubbed
                    the “Asian Unicorn.” So little is known about the Saola that there is no real data on the elusive
                    animal’s current population. Because the Saola has only been seen in the wild a handful of times
                    since its remains were first discovered in 1992, population estimates wildly vary from as little as
                    25 individuals to as many as 750. However, researchers believe that the Saola population is much
                    lower, and most likely less than 250.
